## TASK DESCRIPTION:
This task seeks to change the background color of my app from the default background color to any color of my choice (my choice being the shade of blue #D5DAFF). The default text that appears on the app when you create the project is then changed to display my name, and the text size is enlarged to a size of 24. My name is then wrapped in another text element with the bold style applied to it.
